# Week-1
This is the dataset of world air pollutant concentration data. Firstly I import all the libraries that i want to use in my code. Then I upload the dataset, and check the few starting rows to ensure that my data set is uploaded successfully. Then for understanding the data structure, i check its column, shape and data type. Then check the missing values and fill these missing values. Then check the unique values and use description stat to describe the data. Clean the data for handle the missing values and drop out the duplicates rows. Then use metaplot for making histograms and scatter diagram, which shows the concemtration of pollutants in every country.
